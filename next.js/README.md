# Next.js
The first project I tried to build with Cursor. While it did work, it wasn't that great, it was especially tricky when I had to create a new file and didn't quite know where to put it.

It also felt a bit convoluted and overcomplicated, although that might just be next/react ;)

## Installation
- `npm ci`
- `npm run dev`
