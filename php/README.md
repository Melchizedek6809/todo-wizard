# PHP
After the experiment with next.js, which worked but wasn't great I tried out PHP.

Really worked quite well, I suppose there's enough code out there so the LLM knows the language. And it's also quite nice that you don't have to follow a particular directory structure like in next.js.

## Installation
- Make sure the web directory is served and PHP is executed, also needs sqlite3 (just running `php -S localhost:8080` in the `web/` dir should suffice)
