# ToDo Wizard
Here I'm experimenting with the Cursor AI Editor to see which frameworks/languages work best with it.

Generally I try to write as little code as possible and let the LLM do most of the work.

To keep things somewhat comparable I'm writing multiple versions of a ToDo App, since it's simple enough to complete but you still have the whole user/session management stuff to figure out.
